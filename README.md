# horse-racing-prediction-model

Growing up in Saratoga Springs, I've always been fascinated with horse racing. <a href="https://www.nyra.com/saratoga/">Saratoga Race Course</a> is where I have spent many summer days, cheering on my favorite horse to win any given race. With the sport, as with most, there is lots of data that is tracked and can be used. Past performances track the position of a horse at given checkpoints in a race, allowing handicappers to understand the speed and style of a horse. Using this data, I wanted to build a model that builds my knowledge with machine learning and is something I am passionate about.
